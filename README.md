# About Repository
In this repository I will build a classification model to predict building damage in Nepal inspired by the early earthquake in Syria and Turkey

This project was inspired by the lesson I learned in [WQU](https://www.wqu.edu/)

After working on this notebook I started branching out to work on the [Richter's Predictor Competitor](https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/57/nepal-earthquake/page/136/)
# Installation
This is a Jupyter notebook. Package requirements are included in requirement.txt. This project uses Python 3.9. Run the following command in terminal to install the required packages. `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

# Useage
The notebook includes all the markdowns which explain the process.

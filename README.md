# Classification-Earthquake-Damage-in-Nepal
In this repository I will build a classification model to predict building damage in Nepal inspired by the early earthquake in Syria and Turkey

This project was inspired by the lesson I learned in [WQU](https://www.wqu.edu/)

After working on this notebook I started branching out to work on the [Richter's Predictor Competitor](https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/57/nepal-earthquake/page/136/)
